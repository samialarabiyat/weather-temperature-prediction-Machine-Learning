# weather-temperature-prediction-Machine-Learning
Machine learning project using multiple regression models (Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LSTM) to predict temperature from historical weather data.
# 🌦️ Weather Temperature Prediction using Regression Models

This project demonstrates various regression models to predict temperature based on weather data.

## 📊 Models Used:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression (binned)
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- LSTM (Keras RNN)

## 📁 Dataset
- File: `weatherHistory.csv`
- Source: Historical weather data with temperature, humidity, wind, etc.

## 📈 Metrics Used:
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- R² Score
- Custom Accuracy (±2°C tolerance)

## 🧪 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Run the notebook (`weather_regression_models.ipynb`)
3. All results and plots are generated automatically.

## 🔧 Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for package installation.
